# Phone Guard backlog

Things agreed or parked, newest first within each group. Not a promise of order. See `SPEC.md` for the design.

## Agreed, not started

### Sound profile per mode (added 2026-11-07)
Each mode gets a sound setting. **School defaults to silent.** Day and Night default to normal
(Night may want vibrate; the owner to say).

Design notes to settle when it is picked up:
- Setting per mode: normal, vibrate, silent. Possibly "silent except parents" (below).
- Mechanism: `AudioManager.setRingerMode`. Vibrate needs nothing special. **Silent needs Do Not Disturb
  access** on Android 9 and later; a device owner cannot self-grant it, so it is probably one more adb
  setup grant (`adb shell cmd notification allow_dnd io.github.durkimat.phoneguard`), like grayscale and
  usage access. Check on the J36 first.
- Keep her from undoing it: `DISALLOW_ADJUST_VOLUME` (and `DISALLOW_UNMUTE_DEVICE`) while the mode
  wants a fixed profile; clear it again when the mode allows normal sound.
- Safety question to decide: silent means a parent's call does not ring. Options: allow starred
  contacts through (Do Not Disturb with starred callers allowed, repeat callers allowed), or leave
  calls audible and silence only messages and app notifications. Emergency calls are never affected.
- Alarms: the alarm stream is separate from the ringer, so a morning alarm still sounds in School
  unless we decide otherwise. Decide whether the clock alarm should be allowed in School.
- Restore on leaving the mode: put the ringer back to what it was, not to a fixed value.
- HA: `sound` field on each mode (`normal | vibrate | silent`), a selector per mode in the card's
  "Modes and apps" table, `copy_settings` "mode options" to include it, new devices get
  `school.sound = "silent"`. Existing devices have no value and keep behaving as normal until set.
- Add to the rig: set a mode, read `AudioManager.ringerMode`, try to change the volume, check it holds.

### Full Nokia interface for School (added 2026-11-07)
Owner's brief: every screen in School mode replicates the original Nokia interface, with only slight
tweaks where a feature needs one (for example WhatsApp). The phone must read as a plain dumb phone
because the school bans smartphones. Today only the home screen and the main menu are ours; Messaging,
Contacts and the dialler are the stock Android apps.

To build, one built-in Nokia screen at a time, inside the launcher engine so every skin can draw them:
- **Messages**: the original SMS interface (inbox, write message, sent, drafts, templates, delivery
  reports, message settings). **WhatsApp lives in this same interface** (see the open question below),
  not as a separate smartphone app.
- **Contacts** (Phonebook): the original list, search, view, add, edit, delete, speed dials, my number.
- **Calculator**: add it to the menu with an original-style calculator screen.
- **Check what else Nokia had** and decide each (candidates below).

Original-Nokia features to consider (to be confirmed against a reference model's manual):
- Call register: missed, received and dialled calls, call duration.
- Profiles (General, Silent, Meeting, Outdoor, Pager): ties in with the sound-profile item above, so
  one "profile" setting per mode could be the same thing.
- Settings: time and date, tones, display, call settings (parents' choice what is exposed).
- Organiser: alarm clock (off in School by design), calendar, to-do, notes.
- Extras: stopwatch, countdown timer, unit converter; games (Snake) as an optional Day or Night item
  only, never in School unless a parent turns it on.
- Predictive text: T9 is already the keyboard (`io.github.sspanak.tt9`); keep it.

Open questions:
- **Which Nokia is the reference?** Owner (2026-11-07): not fixed. It can borrow from any of the monochrome
  Nokias; goal is consistency with no fall-back to native Android apps. Owner wants to choose from
  mock-ups before any build.
  (Original question:) A monochrome Series 30 (3310 or 3410 style), a 6310, or another.
  This decides the look, the menu numbering, and what exists.
- **WhatsApp inside the Nokia messages screen: how?** (researched 2026-11-07, third-party sources)
  - Official route: **companion mode**. WhatsApp lets a second Android phone be linked to an existing
    account (Linked devices, scan a QR code), up to four linked devices including web and desktop. Her
    smartphone stays primary and keeps her number; the J36 runs the official app as a linked phone,
    needs no SIM for WhatsApp, and keeps end-to-end encryption. The primary phone must come online at
    least every 14 days or the link lapses.
  - Beeper is a Matrix service that bridges WhatsApp with the open-source `mautrix-whatsapp` bridge,
    which behaves like a linked device (it uses the `whatsmeow` library). It is unofficial, and the
    bridge decrypts and re-encrypts messages, so it is not end to end.
  - Unofficial clients (whatsmeow, and Baileys, which is what the "WhatsApp Gateway" app already on
    the owner's HA is built on) are reported to break WhatsApp's terms and to risk account bans. The
    risk level is anecdotal but consistent. Not recommended on her real number.
  - The only official API is the WhatsApp Business Platform: businesses only, not personal accounts.
  - **Recommended spike: official companion mode plus notifications.** Install the real WhatsApp on the
    J36 as a companion to her account. WhatsApp stays allowed (not hidden, or it cannot post anything)
    but is left out of the menu. A notification listener in the launcher reads the sender and text from
    each WhatsApp notification into our Messages screen, and replies through the notification's own
    reply action. The listener can be enabled by the controller (it holds WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS).
    Limits to expect: only messages received while the listener runs (no old history), text only (no
    voice notes, photos or calls), replies only to a conversation with a live notification (starting a
    brand-new chat is not possible this way), and it depends on WhatsApp keeping its notifications on.
  - To run the spike: link the J36 to a test WhatsApp account by scanning a QR from a phone (a user
    action, with the user's own account), grant notification access, and try read and reply.
- **Outside School** everything reverts: the launcher setting is per mode, so Day and Night use the normal
  launcher and the stock Messaging, Contacts and Phone apps. Messages and contacts live in the shared
  system databases, so both interfaces show the same data. The default SMS and dialler roles would be
  switched per mode by the controller.
- **WhatsApp bridge runs ON THE PHONE, not in HA: owner's later decision (2026-11-07). This supersedes the
  HA-hosted bridge design below.** Reason: HA should only control and monitor what the phone can do;
  messaging must not stop when HA is down.
  - Approach: embed the open-source Go library `whatsmeow` (the one `mautrix-whatsapp` and Beeper's
    bridge use; licence MPL-2.0, fine as a library in an Apache-2.0 app) in the controller app as an
    Android library built with `gomobile`, behind a thin Go wrapper: connect, pair, receive events,
    send text, list contacts. Arm64 only (the J36 is `arm64-v8a`, 2.9 GB RAM, 21 GB free). No
    precedent for this exact combination turned up in a quick search, so it is unproven until a spike.
  - Pairing: the phone asks for a pairing code (link by phone number) and she or a parent types it into
    Linked devices on her smartphone. No camera or QR needed. Done once, in a normal (touch) mode.
  - Where things live: the session keys, the allowlist copy, and the last ~20 messages per allowed chat
    sit in the app's private storage on the phone. HA holds only settings (allowlist, rate limits, on
    or off) and monitoring (connected or logged out, counts). Settings are cached, so it all works with
    HA down. Parents cannot read chats.
  - Connection and battery: a linked device needs a live connection; the foreground service keeps it,
    but the J36 battery is small. Policy to measure: connect in modes that need it (School), reconnect
    periodically elsewhere to collect queued messages. Needs a battery measurement before committing.
  - Unknowns the spike must answer: does whatsmeow build and run under gomobile on this phone; RAM and
    battery cost of the connection; how long WhatsApp queues messages for a linked device that is
    offline; how often the library needs updating when WhatsApp bumps its client version (it needs
    updating from time to time, so the app needs an update path); pairing by code works.
  - **Spike result 1 (2026-11-07, `spikes/wa-size/`, no account linked):** `whatsmeow` (latest, a commit dated
    the same day, so it is actively maintained) plus a pure-Go SQLite store builds to a **16 MB static
    arm64 program** with no NDK (about a third of that once compressed in an APK). Run on the J36 it
    connected to WhatsApp's servers and held the connection for 90 s using **19 MB of memory** (2 MB Go
    heap, 9 goroutines) and about **0.03 s of CPU in 80 s idle**. Android needs two small workarounds in
    plain Go: its own DNS resolver and embedded root certificates. So size and idle weight are not a
    problem. Still unmeasured: a *paired* session (initial sync, keeping contacts, receiving and
    sending) and real battery drain over hours. Both need an account linked by pairing code, which is
    a user action on a smartphone.
  - Toolchain: Go 1.27.3 is installed in `~/.local/gotool` (no sudo). `gomobile` and the Android NDK
    (about 1 GB) are only needed to turn it into an Android library later. Ask before downloading.
  - Same account-ban risk as any unofficial linked device: low volume and allowlist only help.
- (Superseded, HA-hosted variant) **WhatsApp bridge: owner's decision (2026-11-07).** Use a bridge so a chat can be started and a little history seen,
  accepting the unofficial-library risk because School use is low volume. Design brainstorm:
  - Existing "WhatsApp Gateway" app on the owner's HA (FaserF, Baileys) is a bot gateway: REST with
    `X-Auth-Token`, `POST /send_message {number, message}`, `GET /contacts`, a polling `GET /events` queue
    that empties when read, and an optional webhook. No history, one account, and polling it would steal
    events from the owner's own automations. So build our own small bridge app ("Phone Guard WhatsApp
    bridge", a Home Assistant app) as an extra linked device on her account (another slot, no clash).
  - Bridge: pairs by QR or pairing code scanned on her smartphone (Linked devices); allowlist of chats;
    drops everything else on arrival (nothing stored for other chats, groups, media or status); text
    only; rate limits (messages per hour and per day, minimum gap, typing presence like the existing
    app); alerts in HA when the session drops or is logged out; credentials stored in the app's private
    storage. Stored retention is a family decision, see below.
  - Plumbing: bridge talks only to our HA integration (internal). The integration pushes a nudge when a
    message arrives and answers new signed request kinds from the phone: `wa_threads`, `wa_thread`
    (a chat, newest page), `wa_send` (text, to an allowed contact, with a client id so a retry never
    double sends). No persistent socket on the phone; battery as today.
  - Phone: one Messages screen shows SMS and WhatsApp chats together (a chat is one entry with an
    [SMS] or [WA] tag and an unread count); open a chat to scroll the last ~20 messages with Up and
    Down; Reply and Write message use our own text field with the T9 keyboard; recipient picked from
    the allowed contacts; marks for sent, delivered, read; photos and voice notes show as [photo] and
    [voice message] placeholders; unread count on the home screen.
  - Card: a list of her WhatsApp contacts with a tick for "may message in School", plus the limits.
  - Open decisions for the owner: (1) where does history live: only on the phone (HA keeps an in-transit
    queue and delivery marks, parents cannot read chats) or also in HA (parents can read, needs an
    honest conversation with her first); (2) which modes the bridge serves (School only, or the Nokia
    screens whenever that launcher is on); (3) reuse the owner's own session for a first test or use a
    spare number.
  - Lower-risk alternative kept in reserve: official companion mode on the J36 plus a notification
    listener (read and reply, no history, no new chats), optionally plus an accessibility service to
    press Send after a `wa.me` deep link opens a new chat. No unofficial protocol at all.
  - Phases: mock-ups and choice of look; bridge app and integration plumbing with a one-contact
    end-to-end test; Messages screens on the phone (SMS first, then WhatsApp); the card controls;
    hardening (reconnect, session loss alerts, rate limits, backups of the session).
- **Our own SMS app or the stock one?** A built-in screen needs to be the default SMS app; a device
  owner can set the default SMS application. The stock app would then be hidden in School.
- **Our own call screens?** Replacing the incoming-call and in-call screens means becoming the default
  dialler (an InCallService). Emergency calls must always work. Needs a SIM to test.
- **Contacts**: read and write through the Android contacts provider (the permissions can be
  pre-granted by the device owner); decide whether a parent controls the list from Home Assistant.

Approach: build each screen as engine behaviour (lists, text viewer, text editor, number entry,
dialogs, status line) plus Nokia skin drawing, with unit tests for the behaviour. Start with
Contacts and the calculator (no SIM, no WhatsApp dependency), then Messages, then WhatsApp, then
call screens.

### Lockdown for School and a custom launcher (see SPEC section 11)
Owner's brief (2026-11-07): School should look and behave like a classic Nokia: no pull-down menus,
very few apps (dialler, messages, maybe WhatsApp), keypad and D-pad only. Mock-up shown and discussed
before building. Non-School modes use the normal launcher.

Per-mode "lockdown" settings to add to the mode model and the card:
- Launcher: Nokia-style (ours) or normal. School = ours, Day and Night = normal by default.
- Touchscreen: on or off. Off in School by default; configurable.
- Pull-down shade: on or off (measured: `setStatusBarDisabled` works with the stock launcher).
- Sound profile (the item above).
- During a boost the less restrictive of the scheduled mode and the boost mode wins for each setting.

How touch can be turned off: our launcher ignores touch itself. For other apps there is no device
owner switch for the touch panel; the plan is an invisible full-screen overlay that swallows touches
(needs "draw over other apps", one more adb setup grant). Dialogs that need a tap (WhatsApp first run,
permission prompts) cannot be answered in School, so set those up in Day first.

Test plan once built: run WhatsApp (read, reply with T9, voice note, answer a call, send a photo) with
touch off and only the D-pad and keypad, and decide what is usable. A later option is touch on only
while a named app (WhatsApp) is in front. Also test: incoming calls under lock-task mode (no SIM
here), alarm clock over lock task, power menu, launcher crash fallback.

Design requirement: several launcher skins (a later, not text-only Nokia style, and others) must be
addable without touching the engine: skin = how it is drawn; engine = behaviour. Skin is a per-mode setting.

Alarms: decided 2026-11-07, School excludes the Clock (hidden, so nothing rings) and is silent; no alarm
screen needed. To do in HA: put `com.android.deskclock` in `unprotect` and list it in the Modes and apps
table so a mode can hide it; default School leaves it unticked; say on the card that alarms set for
School hours are skipped. Calls under lock-task are still untested (no SIM here).

Order: (1) lock-task and touch-overlay experiments with the current launcher (done, results in SPEC); (2) minimal Nokia
launcher in the same app; (3) notification counts and the status line.

### Done 2026-11-07 (kept for the record)
- Per-mode lockdown wired end to end: launcher, touchscreen, shade, kiosk, Home pin, permission pre-grants.
- Mode override (Auto/Day/School/Night) next to Boost in the card.
- Card controls for the lockdown settings; School locked down by default; Clock left out of School, kept in Night.

### Launcher follow-ups (from the first build)
- The strip behind the launcher's status line is drawn darker than the rest of the screen while locked
  down (looks like the system status bar background). Cosmetic.
- Wire the per-mode settings into the controller: launcher (normal or Nokia), touch overlay, shade, lock
  task. Today they only exist as debug commands.
- Pin the Home app explicitly for every mode; otherwise a second Home app makes Android show a chooser.
- Pre-grant runtime permissions for every allowed app so no prompt ever appears (Contacts, Phone,
  Messaging, WhatsApp, Camera). Keypad cannot reliably answer them.
- Skins: add a second skin to prove the split; config field for the skin id.
- Unread counts for WhatsApp and others (needs notification access, an adb grant).
- Test with a SIM: signal bars, incoming call screen under lock-task, call log counts.
- Menu: which apps appear is "visible launcher apps minus plumbing". Make the exclusions and ordering
  configurable from HA.
- Home banner shows "<mode> until <time>"; decide wording for boosts and for Emergency.

## To verify or finish

- Reboot test of the controller with the real PIN entered (direct-boot code is in, untested by an actual reboot).
- Run the real release flow from HA (phone restores everything and gives up device owner) on a
  paired phone, then re-provision.
- Phone-side recovery key and offline release; single-use override code with its lockout.
- Rate limiting on the webhook.
- Publish the HA state as real entities (today it is a plain state written by the integration).
- Real release build: not `testOnly`, no debug receiver, signing, and a written install order
  (adb steps today: device owner, WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS for grayscale, usage access).
- Notification access for counts on a custom launcher (another adb grant).
- Usage: multi-activity apps are slightly under-counted; no per-mode or per-hour breakdown yet.
- Anchor the phone's clock to server time and report drift to HA.
- "Find her phone" boost button in HA: one-off location request plus stepped high-accuracy tracking
  (SPEC section 4g).
- Second launcher fallback and a controller watchdog if the launcher ever crashes.
- Pairing QR printed from HA works in tests via a debug command; scan it on the phone's camera at least once for real.
- Push the latest commits to GitHub (the owner approves each push).

## Nokia launcher themes (decided 2026-11-07)
- Layout (skin) and theme are separate. Theme = background colour + ink colour + selection style; font is monospace for all.
- Themes: Green LCD (default, #a9b98d / #1b2616), Grey (#cfd3cc / #1a1a1a), Amber on dark (#1a1200 / #ffb52e). Selection style: inverted bar (default) or outlined.
- Chosen on the phone only: Settings > Display > Theme, kept across mode changes. HA control (lock/choose) is optional later.
- Mock-ups for home, menu, Messages, WhatsApp conversation and T9 write screen still to be shown before building.
